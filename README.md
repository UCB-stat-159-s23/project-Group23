This is a Reproducible Research Package utilizing [BART Ridership data](https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership) that investigates the effects of COVID-19 on commute trips in Downtown San Francisco and Berkeley. This repository contains an installable package, `project_tools`, which contains relevant functions stored in `utils.py` and test cases in `/test`. Our analysis is comprised of four notebooks: `Mapping_Ridership.ipynb`, `Analysis of ridership of stations with different land use.ipynb`, `___.ipynb`, and `___.ipynb`. All figure outputs are compiled into a primary notebook `main.ipynb`.
