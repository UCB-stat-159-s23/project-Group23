This is a Reproducible Research Package utilizing [BART Ridership data](https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership) that investigates the effects of COVID-19 on commute trips in Downtown San Francisco and Berkeley. This repository contains an installable package, `project_tools`, which contains relevant functions stored in `utils.py` and test cases in `/test`. Our analysis is comprised of four notebooks: `Mapping_Ridership.ipynb`, `Analysis of ridership of stations with different land use.ipynb`, `___.ipynb`, and `Modeling_Post_Covid_Ridership_Using_Pre_Covid_Data.ipynb`. The main analyses are compiled into a primary notebook `main.ipynb`. 

`Mapping_Ridership.ipynb`: Interactive maps showing the ridership of particular stations.\
`Analysis of ridership of stations with different land use.ipynb`: Finding ridership patterns before and after pandemic regarding various land use conditions.\
`Modeling_Post_Covid_Ridership_Using_Pre_Covid_Data.ipynb`: Machine learning model on predicting post-COVID ridership using pre-COVID ridership data.\
`____`: Standard deviation analysis\
