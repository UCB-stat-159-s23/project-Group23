# Analyzing the Impact of Covid-19 on BART Ridership

The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent work-from-home policy have resulted in substantial changes to travel patterns. This study seeks to analyze the differences in ridership patterns before and after the pandemic, shedding light on the shifts in travel behavior during this transformative period. By comparing pre-pandemic data with post-pandemic data, we can gain insights into how travel patterns have been impacted and understand the evolving dynamics of commuter behavior. This investigation will contribute to our understanding of the long-term effects of the pandemic on transportation systems and inform future planning and policy decisions.

The main goal of this study is to investigate the affect of the pandemic (COVID-19) on the BART ridership. We first utilize interactive maps to visualize the declination of the ridership of the selected stations. Then, standard deviation analysis is applied to understand the fluctuation of ridership of the stations. Based on the standard deviation result, we further cluster the stations into several land use categories. Next, we dive into understanding the traveling pattern of those selected stations with different land use category. Finally, a machine learning model is adopted to predict the post-pandemic ridership result using the pre-pandemic data.
