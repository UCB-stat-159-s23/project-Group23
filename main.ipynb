    "This notebook examines the ridership of various important BART stations with different land use over the past five years. A noticeable trend was observed where there was a significant decrease in ridership during the pandemic period regardless of the land use, which began in February 2020. Although people have started returning to their normal lives in 2022, ridership at most stations remains at only 40% of pre-COVID levels. This indicates that the pandemic has had a significant impact on people's way of life. The aim of this study is to compare the ridership patterns before, during, and after the pandemic, with a focus on four specific locations with different land use: 1) San Francisco CBD (commercial land use), 2) Berkeley(academic land use), 3) Oakland(mixed land use), and 4) International Airports(transport land use)."

    "The pandemic led many companies to implement the \"work from home\" policy, allowing employees to work from anywhere instead of commuting to the office. This policy proved successful for some companies, and many continue to implement it. As a result, this study assumes that the number of people traveling to San Francisco CBD for work significantly decreased during and after the pandemic comparing to pre-COVID time. The plots below show that before the pandemic, the selected BART stations (Embarcadero, Montgomery Street, Powell Street, Civic Center) had 20,000 to 50,000 daily trips. However, although ridership has been increasing since 2020, late 2022 data shows only around 10,000 monthly trips. This indicates that although people may feel that things have returned to normal, the pandemic has altered their commuting patterns."

We were assuming that the ridership growth rate might be faster than the commercial area because students need to go back to campus. However, the ridership in Berkeley does not grow faster comparing to the commercial areas. This might be because of the recording of the classes. After the pandemics, many classes starts to provide lecture recordings that student might not need to go to the campus but can finish the course wherever they can connect to the internet.

The reason for selecting these two stations is that, firstly, students constitute the majority of Downtown Berkeley station riders. Because they typically don't own cars, the impact could be much more significant. Secondly, Embarcadero is one of the busiest stations according to BART's website (bart.gov). With the growing popularity of remote working and studying during the pandemic, it is highly likely that the ridership for these two stations has changed drastically.

    "Based on the plots above, there appears to be an annual seasonality with the peak around summer and the trough around winter. In general, there is an increasing trend observed throughout 2010-2015, but it gradually declines afterwards. The variance of ridership over time has been steady, although the variances for the years 2014-2016 are larger than those of other years. To standardize the variance of the data, a Log Transformation has been applied."

    "After taking the first order difference, the data is non-stationary with a strong seasonality at the indies of multiples of 12. To minimize the effect of seasonality, another lag difference of 12 is taken. The resulting data gives a much better result in terms of stationarity. Moreover, the p-value of the adfuller test is below 0.05, allowing us to reject the null and conclude that the differenced data is stationary. The data set is then split into training and testing, and a parameter search is performed on the training set to determine the best arima model. "

    "The difference between the predicted and observed ridership is gradually decreasing, with only a 500-rider average gap expected at the end of 2022. Although the two ridership values will eventually intersect with each other, the current difference implies that Covid-19 has had a significant impact on people's choice of transportation modes. However, it is important to note that the model's training data shows a declining trend after 2015, which means the model could result in negative ridership in the future. The underlying factor that caused the drop remains unknown, but presumably it affected the model's accuracy."
