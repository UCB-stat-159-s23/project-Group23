# Analyzing the Impact of Covid-19 on BART Ridership
**Authors: Noor Wahle, Jiachen Li, Shih-hung Chiu, Jingya Zhao**

This is a Reproducible Research Package utilizing [BART Ridership data](https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership) that investigates the effects of COVID-19 on commute trips in Downtown San Francisco and Berkeley. This repository contains an installable package, `project_tools`, which contains relevant functions stored in `utils.py` and test cases in `/test`. Our analysis is comprised of four notebooks: `Mapping_Ridership.ipynb`, `Analysis_of_Ridership_of_Stations_with_Different_Land_Use.ipynb`, `Ridership_Standard_Deviation_Analysis.ipynb`, and `Modeling_Post_Covid_Ridership_Using_Pre_Covid_Data.ipynb`. The main analyses are compiled into a primary notebook `main.ipynb`.

## Data
The subdirectory `Data/ridership_yyyy` stores the monthly ridership files for a particular year. These files contain actual ridership counts presented as "entry-exit" matrices, with each page displaying the average ridership for the month based on the type of day (weekday, Saturday, or Sunday) in a matrix format. To help with reference, the station names in the files are abbreviated and can be found in the `station-names.xls` file.

## Analysis
* `Mapping_Ridership.ipynb`: Interactive maps showing the ridership of particular stations.
* `Analysis_of_Ridership_of_Stations_with_Different_Land_Use.ipynb`: Finding ridership patterns before and after pandemic regarding various land use conditions.
* `Modeling_Post_Covid_Ridership_Using_Pre_Covid_Data.ipynb`: Machine learning model on predicting post-COVID ridership using pre-COVID ridership data.
* `Ridership_Standard_Deviation_Analysis.ipynb`: Identifying stations with high ridership variance.

## Installation

To install the package, please follow the command listed below on your terminal:

* Create the bartproject environment: make env
* Install the project_tools module, navigate to the project_tools file and enter: pip install .
* Remove any previous figure or data files from the project directory: make clean
* Execute Jupyter Notebooks and create the figures and data: make all

## Testing and Automation

To test the data, enter the following commands in your terminal:

* Activate the environment: conda activate bartproject
* Run all tests for the functions: pytest project_tools
